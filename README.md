## Project Overview

Politics and governmental rule have always been a source of discussion and debate in societies throughout history. Today, debate and conversation plays a key part in democracy. In the United States, voters are encouraged to engage in conversations with like-minded peers and dissidents to understand others’ opinions, make informed decisions, and allow all voices to be heard. In the age of the internet, there are more opportunities than ever to engage in discussions regarding politics. Reddit is a popular social media platform full of communities engaging in regular political discussions. Users participate in topical forums called “subreddits” to voice their opinions, share information, and engage with others. Political discussions online point to real-world events and their repercussions in the thoughts and opinions of everyday Americans.
